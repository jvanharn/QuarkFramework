Welcome to the Quark Home Storage System, a Web Interface written to control your own NAS at home.

-Introduction-


-How it came to be-
QuarkHS is a small Web Interface I designed from the need to easily control my
NAS, and letting the rest of my family acces their own files, my media etc.
They where always asking me if I could get this film, or this Album, until I got
sick of it. So, I got a small Intel Atom board, a harddisk and tried some NAS
-software on it. I first tried FreeNAS 7, which looked very promissing.. Until
I found out it didn't support my NIC. Tried to manually install the drivers, but
failed misserably. So I thought, we'll just try the FreeNAS 8 Beta(At the time),
which failed at another front, it didn't have Transmission, and lacked many
other features. After FreeNAS I tried many other NAS related distros, which all
just didn't cut it for what I wanted: A home storage system on which I could put
my media, AND at the same time host my coding projects, maybe a small site, etc.
